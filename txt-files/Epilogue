	Epilogue:

		I was raised on the streets of Gotham.
		Up until recently I've been involved, with relative anonymity, 
		in gang crime - armed robbery, murder - but change is in the air in this city.
		The Batman's arm has grown long and it seems no 'bad guy' is safe in what once 
		was the uncontested province of the mob.
		Gotham though still finds itself vulnerable to 
		those who dare stand up to convention... whether they choose the light OR the dark.
		Whispers have emerged of someone without fear, someone without empathy, someone that 
		does not discriminate against the good, the bad, the weak or the strong.
		No one knows who he really is. All I know is that they call him The Joker.
