A game which simulates the opening sequence of the Christopher Nolan film, 'The Dark Knight'.
The player plays as one of the Joker's henchman. The decisions they make will determine whether the
mission (to rob the bank) is accomplished and, ultimately, whether they survive the 'Clown Prince of Crime's'
fiersome reputation for killing his own men as soon as they complete the work that he assigns them.
 
The player is able to carry two objects with them at any one time. These can be any of the following: 
	Mask (CLOTHING), 
	Grenades (WEAPON), 
	Gun (WEAPON), 
	Knife (WEAPON), 
	Car_Keys (TOOL), 
	Drill (TOOL), 
	Bulletproof_vest (CLOTHING)
The player is only able to make use of one WEAPON or TOOL item at any one time. This is know as 
the item 'at hand'; the other being the item 'in pocket'. CLOTHING items are worn as they are acquired.
 
The player is able to move between 5 different rooms. These are the following:
	West Van Buren St,
	Van,
	Gotham National Bank (Main Hall),
	Gotham National Bank (Outside Safe),
	Gotham National Bank (Inside Safe),
	School Bus
The player can choose to move between adjacent rooms at any time. Their choices however may influence the outcome
of the mission and could prevent them from progressing in the game.
